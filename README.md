 Data Mapping and Filtering Using Reference Excel Sheet

##  Project Overview

This project filters and maps records from a reference Excel file (`reference_data.xlsx`) based on identifiers provided in a raw CSV file (`raw_data.csv`). It generates a clean, deduplicated dataset (`mapped_output.csv`) containing only matched entries.



## ðŸ§¾ User Story

**Title:**  
As a developer, I want to filter rows from a reference Excel file based on values present in a raw_data file so that I can generate a mapped output dataset.

**Description:**  
- The `raw_data.csv` contains 100 records with a column named `lookup_key`.
- The `reference_data.xlsx` contains detailed records including the same `lookup_key` column.
- The script matches `lookup_key` values from raw data against the reference, extracts matching rows, and saves the output to `mapped_output.csv`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only rows with matching `lookup_key` values from raw data are included.
- The output contains all columns from the reference sheet.
- Duplicate `lookup_key` entries in raw data are handled (no duplicate rows in the output).
- The output is saved as `mapped_output.csv`.
